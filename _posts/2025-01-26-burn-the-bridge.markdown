Looking back, the times in my life with the most progress, when I was most focused, was my interview preparation for Amazon. I would do 5 online interviews per week for 9 months, and dissect the Amazon interview question bank to fully understand its leadership principles.

I was that dedicated because I knew I had 1 shot at it during my MBA at Cornell. I knew I paid $150K USD in tuition for that 1 shot I have at elevating myself to a FAANG level employee. This obsession with FAANG is a topic for another day, looking back I should not have been so obsessed with this brand equity.

Back to topic, burning the bridge. This analogy originated from military, as in cutting off all your backup plans, no retreats, so you know if you don't succeed, you are basically fucked. This is how you drive progress. It may not be sustainable long term, but it sure makes you feel alive.

Back then I was obsessed with getting that job because for years I suffered from auto-immune disease and I felt I was very behind in life. Up till 29 years old I had nothing to show for my career (as I was sick all the time), and that was devasting to my self-esteem. 

So I knew, I had no retreat, I had to give my 101% to turn my loser life around. Alas, I got that job, being the 1 of 2 in my class who got it, despite having a very weak resume.

I have 3 mottos in life:
1. `Set your heart or light your ass on fire`
2. `Hard decisions, easy life`
3. `Focus on things that compounds`

That fire in me died after I got my offer letter. I was for a long time, without a clear purpose. I quite liked my job, salary and all that but something was missing. 

`There was no urgency and I was doing work that boxed me into a very niche area in the company.` 

I knew it was going against my mottos. There's benefit to choosing your niche and focusing on it, whether it is restaurants/ technology/ finance etc. I was not feeling it in my job.

`We often overestimate the years but underestimate the decades.`

True impact comes from decades of focus, not 1-2 years of effort. As I turn 32, I don't have that many chances at re-choosing my focus. I was unlucky with my health earlier in life, but the past 3 years showed me how much can change. And I am finally, ready to live like how I wanted.

`It feels like the switch in my brain has been turned on. The bridges are burnt again, and it is time to charge forward.`
